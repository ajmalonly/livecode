🎯 Goal:
Build a basic Ruby program to simulate a flight check-in system. The app should allow you to:

Add new passengers

List all passengers

Update a passenger’s seat

Remove a passenger from the list

You should not use classes or advanced Ruby — just basic variables, arrays, hashes, methods, loops, and conditionals.

🛠️ What You Need to Use:
Variables: Store the list of passengers

Arrays: Keep track of all passengers

Hashes: Store passenger details (name, passport, seat)

Methods: Each action (add, list, update, delete) should be in its own method

Loops: Use a loop to keep the menu running until the user chooses to exit

String Interpolation: Use #{} to show data nicely

📝 What to Build
When you run your file (ruby flight_checkin.rb), you should see a menu like this:


🛫 Flight Check-in Manager
1. Add a passenger
2. List all passengers
3. Update passenger seat
4. Remove a passenger
5. Exit
Choose an option (1-5):
🧪 Feature Requirements
Add a Passenger

Ask the user for:

Name

Passport Number

Seat Number

Store this info in a hash and push it to the passengers array.

List All Passengers

Loop through the array and display each passenger like this:


1. John Doe (Passport: AB12345) - Seat: 12A
Update a Passenger’s Seat

Ask for the passport number

If found, ask for a new seat number, and update the hash

Remove a Passenger

Ask for the passport number

Remove that passenger from the array

Exit

Break out of the loop and end the program
